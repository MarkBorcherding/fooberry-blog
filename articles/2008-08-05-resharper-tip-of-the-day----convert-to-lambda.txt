title: ReSharper Tip of the Day -- Convert to Lambda

Since I'm currently stuck in .Net 2.0 within Visual Studio 2005, Lambdas are outside my realm of possibilities; however, as soon as we make the jump to Visual Studio 2008 I will be making much use of this feature.

ReSharper will notice when you have used anonymous delegates in place of a lambda. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-174" title="tolambda" src="http://fooberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/tolambda.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="143" />

And be nice enough to switch them over to a lambda expression for you.

It can also take you back to the anonymous method if you wish.
