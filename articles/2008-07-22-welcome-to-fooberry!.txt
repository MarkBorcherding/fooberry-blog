Welcome to Fooberry.com where sweetness has no context. This is the replacement site for Ontological Reciprocity, which was too hard to type and to difficult to explain. This will be the new home to my <a href="/category/uncategorized/resharper-tip-of-the-day/">ReSharper Tips of the Day</a> and any other ramblings I might have.

So welcome everyone and I hope you enjoy what I have to say.
